        <p class="inside_text">Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific
         tagas, incompatible <u>DOMs</u>, broken <u>CSS</u> support, and abandoned browsers.<br/><br/>
        We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment  has been achieved thanks
         to the tireless efforts of folk like the <u>W3C</u>, <u>WaSP</u>, and the major browser creators.<br/><br/>
        The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons
         of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques
         in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

        <h2 class="title less_padding">So What is This About?</h2>
        <p class="inside_text">
          There is a continuing need to show the power of <u>CSS</u>. The Zen Garden aims to excite,
          inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in
          the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The <u>HTML</u>
          remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external <u>CSS</u> file. Yes, really.<br/><br/>
          <u>CSS</u> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The
          only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what
          it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty
          from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web;
          we can always push it further.

        <h2 class="title less_padding">Participation</h2>
        <p class="inside_text">
          Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong <u>CSS</u>
          skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even <u>CSS</u> novices
          can use them as starting points. Please see the <a href=''>CSS Resource Guide</a> for advanced
          tutorials and tips on working with <u>CSS</u>.<br/><br/>
          You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <u>HTML</u>. This may
          seem dauting at first you've never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more,
          and use the sample files as a guide.<br/><br/>
          Download the sample <a href=''>HTML</a> and <a href=''>CSS</a> to work on a copy locally. Once
          you have completed your masterpieces (and please, don't submit half-finished work) upload your <u>CSS</u>
          file to a web server under your control. <a href=''>Send us a link</a> to an archive of that file and
          all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.

          how amazing <u>CSS</u> really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working
          on the web today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques
          we can all look forward to.
